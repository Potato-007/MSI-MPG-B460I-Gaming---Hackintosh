###  comments

- the iGPU is driving a 34" monitor - 3440 x 1440 @ 60Hz over DispLayPort
- monitor attached via HDMI has a pink coloration after login - see FIX below
- the max refresh rate the mobo supports over HDMI is 30Hz by the specs, but still it outputs 60Hz with the fix below
- Ethernet has to be adjusted to manual 1000baseT - this motherboard has a Realtek 8125B 2.5G LAN connection
- audio works - so far the rear Stereo output has been tested
- sleep works
- USB3 finally works
- if you want to have boot chim, then plug your jack cable into the Red Line-out at the back and set 'AudioSupport' in config.plist to True (it's False now). If you prefer to use the front output of the motherboard - that corresponds to 'Headphones' in audio settings - then change the 'AudioOut' in config.plist to 3

###  fixes

maybe it's not all needed, but have not time to dig deeper...

to fix the ping screen overe HDMI, also add one more entry:
