###  comments

- the iGPU is driving a 34" monitor - 3440 x 1440 @ 60Hz over DispLayPort
- monitor attached via HDMI has a pink coloration after login - see FIX below
- the max refresh rate the mobo supports over HDMI is 30Hz by the specs, but still it outputs 60Hz with the fix below
- Ethernet has to be adjusted to manual 1000baseT - this motherboard has a Realtek 8125B 2.5G LAN connection - Update: manual adjustment not needed since I updated to OC 0.95 and Ventura5 and replaced all the .kexts
- audio works - so far the rear Stereo output has been tested
- sleep works, shutdown works
- USB3 finally works
- Handoff / Continuity, AirDrop works since I updated to OC 0.95 and Ventura
- if you want to have boot chim, then plug your jack cable into the Red Line-out at the back and set 'AudioSupport' in config.plist to True (it's False now). If you prefer to use the front output of the motherboard - that corresponds to 'Headphones' in audio settings - then change the 'AudioOut' in config.plist to 3


###  BIOS settings

- Secure boot OFF
- MSI Fast boot Off
- Fast boot OFF
- Intel VT-D is ON (DisableIoMapper has to be True in Opencore config.plist)
- CFG Lock OFF
- SW Guard OFF
- Above 4G ON
- C1E support ON


###  Benchmarks

Cinebench 23 - 16.030 pts

Vray 5 - 13.015

Geekbench 5 - 1.288 / 10.391

NVMe R/W speed tops at 2.900 MB/s

###  Wi-Fi & BlueTooth

works with:
AirportItlwm.kext
BlueToolFixup.kext
IntelBluetoothFirmware.kext
...since I updated to OC 0.95 and Ventura
however handoff  / continuity / universal keyboard does not work

###  Fixing Shutdown

3 major steps was needed:

- proper USB mapping with setting the onboard LED controller to 'internal' as suggested elsewhere

- applying the shutdown fixes found here https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/misc/shutdown.html
  in case of this mobo the USB contoller path in FixShutdown-USB-SSDT.aml needs to be changed from
  '\_SB.PCI0.XHC.PMEE = Zero' to '\_SB.PCI0.XHC = Zero'

- I also turned off ErP Ready in BIOS

  without these my hackintosh would turn on by itself after a few seconds or randomly during the night
